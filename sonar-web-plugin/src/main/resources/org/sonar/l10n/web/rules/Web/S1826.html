<p>
With the creation of the HTML5 specification, many elements were deprecated, including <code>frame</code>, <code>frameset</code>, and <code>noframes</code>.
</p>
<p>
While many of the other deprecations were motivated by a desire to clean up the specification, the <code>frame*</code> elements were deprecated because:
</p>
<pre>using them damages usability and accessibility</pre>
<p>Therefore frames should be avoided.</p>
